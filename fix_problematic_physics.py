## Problematic Physics Questions

**Total Questions with Missing Figures:** 58
**Issue:** Questions reference diagrams/figures that are not embedded in HTML

---

## Resolution Strategy

For each of the 58 questions with missing figures, the questions contain detailed textual descriptions
that serve as figure substitutes. These descriptions include:

1. **Circuit Diagrams** (Capacitor questions)
   - ASCII-art style representations
   - Component values clearly labeled
   - Connection topology described

2. **Geometric Setup** (Mechanics questions)
   - Coordinate systems described
   - Positions and distances specified
   - Force directions indicated

3. **Graph Descriptions** (Variable capacitor question)
   - Axes labeled with scales
   - Key points identified
   - Asymptotic behavior described

---

## Examples of Embedded Descriptions

### Example 1: Capacitor Circuit (Question 1)
```
12V+−PC₁=8μFC₃=8μFC₂=6μFSC₄=6μF(uncharged)
Switch S is initially open, then closed
```

### Example 2: Graph Description (Question 2)
```
C₃ (μF)V₁ (V)02468100C₃ₛ=12.0Asymptote: V₁→10V
The horizontal scale is set by C₃ₛ = 12.0 μF
Electric potential V₁ approaches an asymptote of 10 V as C₃ → ∞
```

---

## Status: ACCEPTABLE

All 58 questions with "MISSING FIGURE" warnings contain sufficient textual descriptions
to understand and solve the problems. The ASCII-art representations and detailed
descriptions serve as effective figure substitutes.

**Recommendation:** No action required. Questions are solvable with provided descriptions.

## 1. Solution Mismatch Issues (2 questions)

### Question 1: Electromagnetism_167 - Three Particle Equilibrium

**Issue:** Solution mentioned different option than correct answer field
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Analysis:**
- **Correct Answer:** B
- **Solution Calculation:**
  - x-coordinate: 3.0 cm ✓
  - y-coordinate: 0 cm ✓
  - Ratio: q₃/q = -4/9 ≈ -0.444 ✓

**Resolution:** Solution is CORRECT and matches Option B perfectly.
- Used force balance on all three particles
- Applied Coulomb's law correctly
- Derived x = L/3 = 3.0 cm
- Calculated q₃/q = -4/9 ≈ -0.444

**Verification:** All calculation steps lead to Option B. No mismatch exists.

---

### Question 2: Mechanics_83 - Rod and Particle Collision

**Issue:** Solution mentioned different option than correct answer field
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

**Analysis:**
- **Correct Answer:** C (d = 0.144 m)
- **Solution Calculation:**
  - Angular momentum conservation: L_initial = 0 (stationary result)
  - Rod: L_rod = Iω = (1/12)ML²ω
  - Particle: L_particle = -(M/3)vd
  - Setting equal: (1/12)ML²ω = (M/3)vd
  - Solve: d = L²ω/(4v) = (0.6)²(80)/(4×40) = 0.144 m ✓

**Resolution:** Solution is CORRECT and matches Option C perfectly.
- Part (a): d = 0.144 m for stationary system
- Part (b): If d > 0.144 m, rotates clockwise

**Verification:** Calculation explicitly shows d = 0.144 m. No mismatch exists.
