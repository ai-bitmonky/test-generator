Expert test-takers immediately recognize that at 10−8 M concentration, water's contribution dominates. They set up Kw = (10−8 + x)(x) and solve the quadratic, avoiding the temptation to neglect either term.\n    \n    \n    \n        Key Facts Used:\n        \n            Dilution formula: M1V1 = M2V2\n            Kw = [H+][OH−] = 1 × 10−14\n            Common-ion effect on water ionization\n            Quadratic equation solution\n            pH definition: pH = −log[H+]\n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Step 1: Calculate concentration after dilution\n            Using M1V1 = M2V2:\n            (10−5 M)(1 mL) = M2(1000 mL)\n            M2 = 10−5/1000 = 10−8 M\n            \n            Critical observation: At 10−8 M, HCl concentration is much lower than 10−7 M (water's H+).

This is why sulfide salts are generally more soluble in water than predicted by Ksp alone. The principle applies to all salts of very weak acids or bases.",

Elite students immediately recognize that K₂(H₂S) = 10⁻¹⁴ means S²⁻ is extremely basic (pKb ≈ 0), so Kh₁ ≈ 1 indicates nearly complete hydrolysis. They set up the problem recognizing that essentially all dissolved S²⁻ converts to HS⁻, making [HS⁻] ≈ solubility, not [S²⁻].\n    \n    \n    \n        Key Facts Used:\n        \n            Hydrolysis constant: Kh = Kw/Ka (or Kw/Kb for bases)\n            When Kh is large (&gt;0.1), cannot neglect hydrolysis\n            Kh₁ &gt;&gt; Kh₂ means first hydrolysis dominates\n            Electroneutrality: charges must balance\n            Material balance: total Mn = total sulfur species\n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Step 1: Calculate hydrolysis constants\n            For S²⁻ (conjugate base of HS⁻):\n            S²⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HS⁻ + OH⁻\n            Kh₁ = Kw/K₂(H₂S) = (1 × 10⁻¹⁴)/(1 × 10⁻¹⁴) = 1.0\n            \n            For HS⁻ (conjugate base of H₂S):\n            HS⁻ + H₂O ⇌ H₂S + OH⁻\n            Kh₂ = Kw/K₁(H₂S) = (1 × 10⁻¹⁴)/(1 × 10⁻⁷) = 1 × 10⁻⁷\n            \n            Critical observation: Kh₁ = 1.0 is VERY large! First hydrolysis goes nearly to completion.\n        \n        \n        Step 2: Analyze the extent of hydrolysis\n            Since Kh₁ &gt;&gt; Kh₂ (1.0 &gt;&gt; 10⁻⁷), the first hydrolysis is dominant.\n            We can assume: S²⁻ + H₂O → HS⁻ + OH⁻ (goes nearly to completion)\n            \n            This means nearly all dissolved S²⁻ converts to HS⁻.\n        \n        \n        Step 3: Set up material and charge balances\n            Let x = solubility of MnS in moles/L\n            \n            When x moles of MnS dissolve:\n            [Mn²⁺] = x (from MnS dissolution)\n            \n            Since first hydrolysis goes to completion:\n            [HS⁻] ≈ x (nearly all S²⁻ converts to HS⁻)\n            [OH⁻] = x (from hydrolysis)\n            [S²⁻] = very small (most converted to HS⁻)\n        \n        \n        Step 4: Apply first hydrolysis equilibrium\n            S²⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HS⁻ + OH⁻\n            \n            Kh₁ = [HS⁻][OH⁻]/[S²⁻]\n            1.0 = (x)(x)/[S²⁻]\n            [S²⁻] = x²/1.0 = x²\n        \n        \n        Step 5: Apply Ksp equilibrium\n            MnS(s) ⇌ Mn²⁺ + S²⁻\n            \n            Ksp = [Mn²⁺][S²⁻]\n            2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x²)\n            2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x³\n        \n        \n        Step 6: Solve for solubility\n            x³ = 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰\n            x = (2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰)^(1/3)\n            x = (25 × 10⁻¹¹)^(1/3)\n            x = 25^(1/3) × 10⁻¹¹/³\n            x = 2.924 × 10⁻³·⁶⁷\n            x = 2.924 × 10⁻⁴ × 10^(0.33)\n            x ≈ 2.924 × 10⁻⁴ × 2.15\n            x ≈ 6.3 × 10⁻⁴ M\n        \n        \n        Step 7: Verify the answer\n            Check using Ksp:\n            [Mn²⁺] = 6.3 × 10⁻⁴ M\n            [S²⁻] = x² = (6.3 × 10⁻⁴)² = 3.97 × 10⁻⁷ M\n            \n            Ksp = [Mn²⁺][S²⁻]\n            Ksp = (6.3 × 10⁻⁴)(3.97 × 10⁻⁷)\n            Ksp = 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ ✓ (matches given value)\n        \n        \n        Step 8: Compare with naive approach\n            If we ignored hydrolysis (WRONG approach):\n            Ksp = [Mn²⁺][S²⁻] = x × x = x²\n            x = √Ksp = √(2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰)\n            x = 1.58 × 10⁻⁵ M\n            \n            This is 40 times smaller than the correct answer!\n            Hydrolysis dramatically increases solubility by removing S²⁻ from solution.",

This is why sulfide salts are generally more soluble in water than predicted by Ksp alone. The principle applies to all salts of very weak acids or bases.",

Elite students immediately recognize that K₂(H₂S) = 10⁻¹⁴ means S²⁻ is extremely basic (pKb ≈ 0), so Kh₁ ≈ 1 indicates nearly complete hydrolysis. They set up the problem recognizing that essentially all dissolved S²⁻ converts to HS⁻, making [HS⁻] ≈ solubility, not [S²⁻].\n    \n    \n    \n        Key Facts Used:\n        \n            Hydrolysis constant: Kh = Kw/Ka (or Kw/Kb for bases)\n            When Kh is large (&gt;0.1), cannot neglect hydrolysis\n            Kh₁ &gt;&gt; Kh₂ means first hydrolysis dominates\n            Electroneutrality: charges must balance\n            Material balance: total Mn = total sulfur species\n        \n    \n    \n    \n        Step 1: Calculate hydrolysis constants\n            For S²⁻ (conjugate base of HS⁻):\n            S²⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HS⁻ + OH⁻\n            Kh₁ = Kw/K₂(H₂S) = (1 × 10⁻¹⁴)/(1 × 10⁻¹⁴) = 1.0\n            \n            For HS⁻ (conjugate base of H₂S):\n            HS⁻ + H₂O ⇌ H₂S + OH⁻\n            Kh₂ = Kw/K₁(H₂S) = (1 × 10⁻¹⁴)/(1 × 10⁻⁷) = 1 × 10⁻⁷\n            \n            Critical observation: Kh₁ = 1.0 is VERY large! First hydrolysis goes nearly to completion.\n        \n        \n        Step 2: Analyze the extent of hydrolysis\n            Since Kh₁ &gt;&gt; Kh₂ (1.0 &gt;&gt; 10⁻⁷), the first hydrolysis is dominant.\n            We can assume: S²⁻ + H₂O → HS⁻ + OH⁻ (goes nearly to completion)\n            \n            This means nearly all dissolved S²⁻ converts to HS⁻.\n        \n        \n        Step 3: Set up material and charge balances\n            Let x = solubility of MnS in moles/L\n            \n            When x moles of MnS dissolve:\n            [Mn²⁺] = x (from MnS dissolution)\n            \n            Since first hydrolysis goes to completion:\n            [HS⁻] ≈ x (nearly all S²⁻ converts to HS⁻)\n            [OH⁻] = x (from hydrolysis)\n            [S²⁻] = very small (most converted to HS⁻)\n        \n        \n        Step 4: Apply first hydrolysis equilibrium\n            S²⁻ + H₂O ⇌ HS⁻ + OH⁻\n            \n            Kh₁ = [HS⁻][OH⁻]/[S²⁻]\n            1.0 = (x)(x)/[S²⁻]\n            [S²⁻] = x²/1.0 = x²\n        \n        \n        Step 5: Apply Ksp equilibrium\n            MnS(s) ⇌ Mn²⁺ + S²⁻\n            \n            Ksp = [Mn²⁺][S²⁻]\n            2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ = (x)(x²)\n            2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ = x³\n        \n        \n        Step 6: Solve for solubility\n            x³ = 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰\n            x = (2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰)^(1/3)\n            x = (25 × 10⁻¹¹)^(1/3)\n            x = 25^(1/3) × 10⁻¹¹/³\n            x = 2.924 × 10⁻³·⁶⁷\n            x = 2.924 × 10⁻⁴ × 10^(0.33)\n            x ≈ 2.924 × 10⁻⁴ × 2.15\n            x ≈ 6.3 × 10⁻⁴ M\n        \n        \n        Step 7: Verify the answer\n            Check using Ksp:\n            [Mn²⁺] = 6.3 × 10⁻⁴ M\n            [S²⁻] = x² = (6.3 × 10⁻⁴)² = 3.97 × 10⁻⁷ M\n            \n            Ksp = [Mn²⁺][S²⁻]\n            Ksp = (6.3 × 10⁻⁴)(3.97 × 10⁻⁷)\n            Ksp = 2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰ ✓ (matches given value)\n        \n        \n        Step 8: Compare with naive approach\n            If we ignored hydrolysis (WRONG approach):\n            Ksp = [Mn²⁺][S²⁻] = x × x = x²\n            x = √Ksp = √(2.5 × 10⁻¹⁰)\n            x = 1.58 × 10⁻⁵ M\n            \n            This is 40 times smaller than the correct answer!\n            Hydrolysis dramatically increases solubility by removing S²⁻ from solution.",

This demonstrates how pH control is crucial in electrochemical processes!",

Since complex formation is strong:\n            [NH₃] ≈ 2×10⁻² M (if we assume 2x << 2×10⁻²)\n        \n        \n        Step 4: Calculate Kd\n            For the dissociation: [Ag(NH₃)₂]⁺ ⇌ Ag⁺ + 2NH₃\n            Kd = [Ag⁺][NH₃]² / [Ag(NH₃)₂⁺]\n            \n            Let me try with [NH₃] ≈ 2×10⁻² M first:\n            Kd = (1×10-7) × (2×10-2)² / (4×10-3)\n            Kd = (1×10-7) × (4×10-4) / (4×10-3)\n            Kd = (4×10-11) / (4×10-3)\n            Kd = 1×10-8\n        \n        \n        Step 5: Final Answer\n            Kd = 1.0 × 10-8\n            \n            Note: The formation constant Kf = 1/Kd = 1×10⁸\n            This large Kf value indicates that the complex is very stable, which explains why almost all the silver exists as the complex rather than free Ag⁺ ions.",
