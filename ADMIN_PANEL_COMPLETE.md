## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Apply Database Migration

**Option A: Supabase Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `supabase/migrations/20251013000000_create_questions_audit.sql`
3. Paste and execute

**Option B: Supabase CLI**
```bash
supabase db push
```

### 2. Verify Installation

```sql
-- Check audit table exists
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions_audit;

-- Test by updating a question
UPDATE questions
SET difficulty = 'Medium'
WHERE id = (SELECT id FROM questions LIMIT 1);

-- Verify audit record created
SELECT * FROM questions_audit
ORDER BY changed_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 3. Access Admin Panel

Navigate to:
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:3000/admin`
- Questions: `http://localhost:3000/admin/questions`

### Complete Audit Trail
- Automatic logging of all changes (no code changes needed)
- Tracks operation type (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE)
- Records which fields changed
- Stores complete before/after snapshots
- Timestamp and user tracking (when available)

### Version Comparison

- Field-by-field breakdown
- Support for HTML, JSON, arrays, and text

### User-Friendly Interface

## 📊 Statistics & Analytics

The system provides:

- Version history statistics (inserts/updates/deletes)
- Similarity percentages between versions
- Changed field tracking

## 🔧 API Usage Examples

### List Questions
```javascript
// Get questions with filters
fetch('/api/admin/questions?subject=Mathematics&difficulty=Hard&page=1&limit=20')

// Response includes:
// - questions data
// - pagination metadata
// - available filter options
// - applied filters
```

### Get Question Details
```javascript
// Get question with audit info
fetch('/api/admin/questions/123')

// Response includes:
// - complete question data
// - audit_info with latest changes
// - total revision count
```

### View Version History
```javascript
// Get all versions of a question
fetch('/api/admin/questions/123/history')

// Response includes:
// - version list with timestamps
// - statistics (inserts/updates/deletes)
// - pagination for large histories
```

### Compare Versions
```javascript
// Compare two audit records

// Response includes:
// - field-by-field differences
// - similarity percentage
// - metadata for both versions
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Reusable Components Created:
- `StatCard` - Statistics display cards
- `QuestionCard` - Question preview cards
- `SubjectCard` - Subject navigation cards
- `QuestionDetailModal` - Full question details modal
- `VersionCard` - Version history timeline item
- `VersionInfoCard` - Version metadata display
- `DifferenceCard` - Side-by-side comparison card

### Color Schemes:
- **Difficulty**: Green (Easy), Yellow (Medium), Red (Hard)
- **Operations**: Green (INSERT), Blue (UPDATE), Red (DELETE)
- **Status**: Blue (current), Purple (latest), Gray (historical)

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Currently no authentication - add middleware to protect `/admin` routes
2. **Authorization**: No role-based access control - implement based on your needs
3. **Row Level Security**: RLS disabled for flexibility - enable and configure for production
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Consider adding rate limits for API endpoints
5. **Input Validation**: Add validation for user inputs in PATCH/DELETE operations
