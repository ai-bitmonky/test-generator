## üîç Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase to verify:

```sql
-- Total count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions;
-- Result: 632

-- By subject
SELECT subject, COUNT(*) as count
FROM questions
GROUP BY subject;
-- Mathematics: 395
-- Physics: 237

-- By difficulty
SELECT difficulty, COUNT(*) as count
FROM questions
GROUP BY difficulty
ORDER BY difficulty;

-- Math chapters
SELECT chapter, COUNT(*) as count
FROM questions
WHERE subject = 'Mathematics'
GROUP BY chapter
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- Physics chapters
SELECT chapter, COUNT(*) as count
FROM questions
WHERE subject = 'Physics'
GROUP BY chapter
ORDER BY count DESC;
```

## üìù Notes & Exclusions

### Questions Skipped (50 total)

**Mathematics (38 questions)**
- Reason: Missing correct answer in source HTML
- These questions had incomplete answer data in the original HTML file
- Can be manually added later if needed

**Physics (12 questions)**
- Reason: Missing correct answer in source HTML
- Similar issue with incomplete data
- Can be manually added later if needed

### Why Some Questions Were Skipped
- Database requires `correct_answer` to be NOT NULL
- Source HTML had some questions with improperly formatted answers
- Better to exclude than to insert incomplete data
- Quality over quantity approach

---

## üéì Enhanced Features

### For Mathematics Questions
- Chapter-based organization (Algebra, Calculus, etc.)
- Topic and subtopic classification
- Tag-based filtering capability
- Complete step-by-step solutions

### For Physics Questions (Additional)
- **Strategy**: Problem-solving approach for each question
- **Expert Insight**: Tips from experts on recognizing patterns
- **Key Facts**: Formulas, laws, theorems needed for solution
- Rich HTML formatting with diagrams (SVGs preserved)
