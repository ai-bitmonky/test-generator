# Network Resilience Improvements v2.3

## Overview

Enhanced the AI pipeline (`ai_pipeline_fixed.js`) to handle network failures gracefully, including scenarios where the internet connection goes down during processing.

## Changes Made

### 1. Increased Retry Attempts (Line 34)
- **Before**: 3 retries
- **After**: 5 retries
- Provides more opportunities to recover from transient failures

### 2. Increased Base Delay (Line 1217)
- **Before**: 5000ms (5 seconds)
- **After**: 8000ms (8 seconds)
- Reduces likelihood of hitting rate limits

### 3. Network Error Detection (Lines 74-88)
Automatically detects network errors by checking for:
- `fetch failed`
- `ECONNREFUSED`
- `ENOTFOUND`
- `ETIMEDOUT`
- Generic `network` errors

### 4. Extended Wait Times for Network Issues (Line 82)
- **Rate limit errors**: 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s, 75s (progressive backoff)
- **Network errors**: 30s, 60s, 90s, 120s, 150s (longer waits for internet recovery)
- **Other errors**: 15s, 30s, 45s, 60s, 75s (standard backoff)

### 5. User-Friendly Error Messages (Lines 83-85)
When internet is down, the pipeline displays:
```
üåê Network error detected (fetch failed)
‚è≥ Internet may be down. Waiting 30s before retry 1/5...
üí° Pipeline will continue automatically when internet is restored.
```

### 6. Question-Level Error Handling (Lines 1202-1213)
- Wraps each question processing in try-catch
- If a question fails completely (after all retries), pipeline:
  - Logs the error
  - Saves the failure in results
  - **Continues with next question** instead of crashing
- Progress is preserved even if some questions fail

## Behavior During Internet Outage

### Scenario: Internet goes down mid-pipeline

1. **Detection**: Pipeline detects network error on API call
2. **Wait**: Waits 30 seconds before first retry
3. **Retry**: Attempts to reconnect
4. **Progressive backoff**: If still down, waits 60s, 90s, 120s, 150s
5. **Continue or skip**:
   - If internet returns: Resumes normally
   - If all retries fail: Logs error, skips question, continues to next

### Example Log Output

```
üåê Network error detected (fetch failed)
‚è≥ Internet may be down. Waiting 30s before retry 1/5...
üí° Pipeline will continue automatically when internet is restored.

[30 seconds later]

üåê Network error detected (fetch failed)
‚è≥ Internet may be down. Waiting 60s before retry 2/5...
üí° Pipeline will continue automatically when internet is restored.

[Internet comes back]

‚úÖ Question auto-fixed successfully

[Pipeline continues normally]
```

## Benefits

1. **Resilient**: Survives temporary internet outages
2. **Progressive**: Waits longer for persistent issues
3. **Non-blocking**: Doesn't halt entire pipeline for single failures
4. **Informative**: Clear messages about what's happening
5. **Preserves progress**: All successfully processed questions are saved

## Testing Recommendations

To test network resilience:

```bash
# Start pipeline
node ai_pipeline_fixed.js Mathematics

# Simulate internet outage (disconnect WiFi/ethernet)
# Wait 1-2 minutes
# Reconnect internet

# Pipeline should automatically resume
```

## Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Works with existing v2.2 pipeline features
- ‚úÖ Compatible with adaptive rate limiter
- ‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality
- ‚úÖ Backward compatible with all validation agents

## Version History

- **v2.3**: Added comprehensive network resilience
- **v2.2**: Added HTML entity cleanup, combined words, figure warnings
- **v2.1**: Added SVG generation, 100-word limits, tracking improvements
- **v2.0**: Initial AI-enhanced pipeline

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Periodic connection health checks
- [ ] Automatic network diagnostics (ping test)
- [ ] Configurable retry strategies per error type
- [ ] Webhook notifications for extended outages
- [ ] Resume from checkpoint after complete pipeline failure
