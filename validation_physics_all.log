      ⚠️  Solution doesn't match correct answer - will regenerate
         - 1. The solution steps are not shown in the provided answer. There are only headings for "Strategy", "Expert Insight", and "Key Facts Used", but no actual step-by-step solution.
2. Without the solution steps, it is not possible to verify if the logic leads to option B.
3. The solution is incomplete, and the calculations are not provided, so it's not possible to check if they are mathematically correct.
4. The final answer is not shown, so it cannot be compared to the correct answer of option B.

Overall, the provided information is insufficient to fully verify the solution. The solution steps and calculations need to be included for a proper evaluation.

      ⚠️  Solution doesn't match correct answer - will regenerate
         - The solution provided is mostly correct, but there is a discrepancy in the calculated frequency of oscillation. The solution correctly analyzes the initial oscillation and sets up the energy conservation equation. However, the final calculated frequency of 2.23 Hz does not match the correct answer of 1.58 Hz. The solution acknowledges this discrepancy and notes that the numerical answer requires verification of the problem parameters. Overall, the solution is logically sound, but the final frequency calculation is incorrect.
