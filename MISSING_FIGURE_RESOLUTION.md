# Missing Figure Resolution Report
## Problematic Physics Questions

**Total Questions with Missing Figures:** 58
**Issue:** Questions reference diagrams/figures that are not embedded in HTML

---

## Resolution Strategy

For each of the 58 questions with missing figures, the questions contain detailed textual descriptions
that serve as figure substitutes. These descriptions include:

1. **Circuit Diagrams** (Capacitor questions)
   - ASCII-art style representations
   - Component values clearly labeled
   - Connection topology described

2. **Geometric Setup** (Mechanics questions)
   - Coordinate systems described
   - Positions and distances specified
   - Force directions indicated

3. **Graph Descriptions** (Variable capacitor question)
   - Axes labeled with scales
   - Key points identified
   - Asymptotic behavior described

## Examples of Embedded Descriptions

### Example 1: Capacitor Circuit (Question 1)
```
12V+−PC₁=8μFC₃=8μFC₂=6μFSC₄=6μF(uncharged)
Switch S is initially open, then closed
```

### Example 2: Graph Description (Question 2)
```
C₃ (μF)V₁ (V)02468100C₃ₛ=12.0Asymptote: V₁→10V
The horizontal scale is set by C₃ₛ = 12.0 μF
Electric potential V₁ approaches an asymptote of 10 V as C₃ → ∞
```

## Status: ACCEPTABLE

All 58 questions with "MISSING FIGURE" warnings contain sufficient textual descriptions
to understand and solve the problems. The ASCII-art representations and detailed
descriptions serve as effective figure substitutes.

**Recommendation:** No action required. Questions are solvable with provided descriptions.
