## SUMMARY OF ISSUE TYPES

### Critical Issues (Need Immediate Fixing)
1. **Question 14** - All 4 capacitor values completely missing
2. **Question 36** - INCORRECT value shown (0.20 m instead of 1.0 cm)
3. **Question 31** - Both radius and distance missing
4. **Question 194** - Loop radius completely missing

### High Priority Issues (Important Values Missing)
- Missing dimensions: Questions 10, 11, 12, 16, 26, 31, 35, 37, 41, 109, 119, 171, 182, 198, 213
- Missing angles: Questions 108, 121, 149
- Missing masses: Questions 171, 182, 197

### Medium Priority Issues (Values Present but Could Be Clearer)
- Missing secondary dimensions: Questions 20, 23, 42, 138, 152, 178, 183, 201, 206, 208
- Missing angles in diagrams: Questions 155, 183, 201
- Missing radii: Questions 173, 180, 187, 190, 192, 199, 215

### Low Priority (False Positives or Optional)
- Questions 2, 5, 72, 73, 79, 82, 83, 103 - Values are present but in slightly different format

---

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Fix Question 36** - Correct the wrong radius value (CRITICAL ERROR)
2. **Add all capacitor values to Question 14** - Circuit diagram useless without them
3. **Add dimensions to Questions 10, 11, 31** - Physical setup unclear without them
4. **Add loop radius to Question 194** - Problem cannot be visualized

### High Priority Fixes:
- Add all missing dimensions to capacitor and charge problems (Q12, 16, 20, 23, 26, 35, 37, 41, 42)
- Add angles to vector and force problems (Q108, 119, 121, 149)
- Add dimensions to mechanics problems (Q109, 152, 171, 178, 182, 197, 198, 213)

### Process Improvements:
1. Create a checklist: "Does every numerical value mentioned in the question appear in the diagram?"
2. Review all SVG diagrams before finalizing HTML files
3. Ensure units are consistent (cm vs m, degrees with ° symbol)
4. Add legends/tables for problems with multiple charges or capacitors

---

## METHODOLOGY

This analysis was performed using automated Python scripts that:
1. Extracted all question text and SVG content from HTML files
2. Identified numerical values with units in question text
3. Searched for these values in SVG text labels
4. Flagged missing values as potential issues
5. Generated detailed reports for manual verification

**Note:** Some issues may be false positives where values are present but formatted slightly differently (e.g., "100 V" vs "100.0 V"). These have been marked as LOW priority.

**Report Generated:** October 14, 2025
**Total Issues Identified:** 54 diagrams with missing or incorrect information
**Recommended Action:** Review and update SVG diagrams based on priority levels above
