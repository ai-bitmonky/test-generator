=============================================

FILE: physics_questions_01_of_05.html
LOCATION: Lines 7165-7284
QUESTION HEADER: "Question 28" (contains Question 14 content about bee and pollen)

NEW SVG STRUCTURE VERIFIED:
✓ ViewBox: 0 0 800 500 (wider format for two scenarios)
✓ Title: "Question 14: Bee and Pollen Electrostatics"
✓ Vertical dividing line separating scenarios

LEFT SCENARIO (Lines 7181-7228):
✓ Title: "Scenario 1: Bee with Pollen"
✓ Honeybee sphere (r=80, golden color #FFD700)
  - Charge: +45.0 pC (red + symbol)
  - Diameter labeled: 1.000 cm
✓ Pollen grain on surface (r=12, pale goldenrod)
  - Near charge: −1.00 pC (blue, labeled "near")
  - Far charge: +1.00 pC (red, labeled "far")
  - Diameter labeled: 40.0 μm
✓ Force arrow Fbee (orange, pointing to pollen)
✓ Labels: "Bee (sphere)" and "Pollen grain"

RIGHT SCENARIO (Lines 7230-7273):
✓ Title: "Scenario 2: Pollen near Stigma"
✓ Pollen grain (same size, with induced charges)
  - Diameter labeled: 40.0 μm
✓ Stigma tip (green circle, r=15)
  - Charge: −45.0 pC (blue − symbol)
  - Label: "Stigma tip"
✓ Distance dimension: 1.000 mm (with measurement line)
✓ Force arrow Fstigma (blue, pointing toward stigma)

LEGEND BOX (Lines 7276-7283):
✓ Title: "Key Information"
✓ Bee specifications: Q = +45.0 pC, d = 1.000 cm
✓ Pollen specifications: induced charges (−1.00 pC near, +1.00 pC far), d = 40.0 μm
✓ Stigma specifications: Q = −45.0 pC
✓ Distance: 1.000 mm

COLOR CODING:
✓ Positive charges: Red (#cc0000)
✓ Negative charges: Blue (#0066cc)
✓ Bee: Gold (#FFD700)
✓ Pollen: Pale goldenrod (#F0E68C)
✓ Stigma: Green (#228B22)
✓ Force arrows: Orange (#ff6600) for Fbee, Blue (#0066ff) for Fstigma

ALL REQUIREMENTS MET:
✓ Two scenarios clearly separated
✓ All dimensions labeled (1.000 cm, 40.0 μm, 1.000 mm)
✓ All charges labeled (+45.0 pC, −1.00 pC, +1.00 pC, −45.0 pC)
✓ Induced charges shown with proper signs
✓ Force arrows clearly labeled (Fbee, Fstigma)
✓ Color coding for positive/negative charges
✓ Professional appearance with legend

STATUS: ✅ COMPLETE AND VERIFIED
