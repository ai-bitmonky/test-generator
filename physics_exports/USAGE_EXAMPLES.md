## Advanced Usage

### Batch Processing Multiple Questions

Create a file `questions.txt`:
```
A block of mass 5kg is on an incline at 30 degrees
A point charge Q = +5ŒºC is at origin
A convex lens has focal length 10cm
```

Then process all:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
i=1
while read question; do
  python3 generate_diagram.py "$question" -o "diagram_$i.svg"
  i=$((i+1))
done < questions.txt
```

---

### Python Scripting

```python
from universal_physics_diagram_generator import generate_diagram_from_question

# List of questions
questions = [
    "A block slides down an incline at angle 30 degrees",
    "A point charge Q creates electric field E",
    "A convex lens forms an image"
]

# Generate all diagrams
for i, question in enumerate(questions, 1):
    output = f"auto_diagram_{i}.svg"
    generate_diagram_from_question(question, output)
    print(f"‚úÖ Generated: {output}")
```

---

### Custom Parsing

```python
from universal_physics_diagram_generator import QuestionParser

question = "A block of mass 5kg is on an incline at 30 degrees"

# Parse first
parsed = QuestionParser.parse_question(question)

print("Detected Information:")
print(f"  Topic: {parsed['topic']}")
print(f"  Diagram Type: {parsed['diagram_type']}")
print(f"  Objects: {parsed['objects']}")
print(f"  Vectors: {parsed['vectors']}")
print(f"  Given Info: {parsed['given_info']}")

# Then generate if satisfied
# ... generate diagram ...
```

---

### Quality Assurance Check

After generating a diagram, verify compliance:

```bash
# Check for solution content (should be empty)
grep -i "answer\|solution\|equal to.*=" generated_diagram.svg

# Check for proper vector notation (should find SVG paths)
grep "<path.*overhead" generated_diagram.svg

# Check font sizes
grep -o 'font-size="[0-9]*"' generated_diagram.svg | sort | uniq
```

Expected output:
```
# No matches for solution content
# Multiple matches for overhead arrows
# Font sizes: 20, 26, 32, 36, 42, 44
```

## üéì Tips for Best Results

### 1. Be Specific
‚ùå Bad: "A charge creates a field"
‚úÖ Good: "A point charge Q = +5ŒºC at origin creates electric field E"

### 2. Include Units
‚ùå Bad: "A block of mass 5"
‚úÖ Good: "A block of mass 5 kg"

### 3. Mention Object Types
‚ùå Bad: "Two things connected by a rope"
‚úÖ Good: "Two blocks connected by a rope"

### 4. Specify Vectors
‚ùå Bad: "Find the force"
‚úÖ Good: "Find the force F acting on the block"

### 5. Avoid Solution Language
‚ùå Bad: "Show that F = ma"
‚úÖ Good: "A force F acts on mass m"
