# Question 14/28 SVG Diagram Redraw Report

## Task Completed
Successfully redrawn the SVG diagram for Question 14 (listed as Question 28 in the HTML header) in the file:
`/Users/Pramod/projects/iit-exams/jee-test-nextjs/physics_exports/physics_questions_01_of_05.html`

## Location
- **File**: physics_questions_01_of_05.html
- **Lines**: 6988-7284 (approximately)
- **Question Number in Header**: Question 28
- **Question Content**: Question 14: Bee and Pollen Electrostatics

## New SVG Design

The new diagram shows **TWO distinct scenarios side-by-side**:

### Left Side: Scenario 1 - Bee with Pollen Grain
- **Honeybee sphere**:
  - Diameter: 1.000 cm (clearly labeled)
  - Charge: +45.0 pC (shown with red + symbol)
  - Color: Golden (#FFD700)
  - Radius: 80px in SVG coordinates

- **Pollen grain** (on bee surface):
  - Diameter: 40.0 μm (labeled)
  - Color: Pale goldenrod (#F0E68C)
  - **Induced charges clearly shown**:
    - Near side (facing bee): −1.00 pC (blue, marked with −)
    - Far side (away from bee): +1.00 pC (red, marked with +)
  - Labels indicate "(near)" and "(far)" for clarity

- **Force arrow Fbee**:
  - Orange color (#ff6600)
  - Points from bee toward pollen grain
  - Labeled with subscript "bee"

### Right Side: Scenario 2 - Pollen near Stigma
- **Pollen grain**:
  - Same size (d = 40.0 μm)
  - Shows induced charges (−1.00 pC and +1.00 pC)
  - Positioned at proper distance from stigma

- **Stigma tip**:
  - Green sphere (#228B22)
  - Charge: −45.0 pC (shown with blue − symbol)
  - Labeled "Stigma tip"

- **Distance measurement**:
  - Clear dimension line showing 1.000 mm
  - Dashed line with measurement markers
  - Distance between pollen center and stigma center

- **Force arrow Fstigma**:
  - Blue color (#0066ff)
  - Points from pollen toward stigma
  - Labeled with subscript "stigma"

### Visual Elements
1. **Title**: "Question 14: Bee and Pollen Electrostatics" at top
2. **Dividing line**: Vertical dashed line separating the two scenarios
3. **Scenario titles**: Clear headers for each side
4. **Color coding**:
   - Positive charges: Red (#cc0000)
   - Negative charges: Blue (#0066cc)
   - Neutral/objects: Yellow/gold tones
5. **Legend box** at bottom with key information:
   - Bee specifications
   - Pollen specifications with induced charges
   - Stigma specifications
   - Distance measurement

## Technical Details
- **ViewBox**: 0 0 800 500 (wider to accommodate both scenarios)
- **Original SVG**: 600×450, single confused diagram
- **New SVG**: 800×500, two clear side-by-side scenarios
- **File size change**: Added ~70 lines of SVG code
- **Color scheme**: Professional with clear positive/negative charge distinction

## Improvements Over Original
1. **Clarity**: Two separate scenarios instead of overlapping elements
2. **Labels**: All dimensions and charges clearly labeled
3. **Visual distinction**: Clear separation between the two physical situations
4. **Educational value**: Shows both force scenarios students need to analyze
5. **Charge representation**: Induced charges on pollen grain clearly shown with ± symbols
6. **Measurements**: All specified dimensions (1.000 cm, 40.0 μm, 1.000 mm) labeled
7. **Legend**: Summary box with all key parameters

## Verification
The SVG has been successfully integrated into the HTML file and displays:
- Left scenario: Bee holding pollen via electrostatic attraction
- Right scenario: Pollen being pulled toward stigma
- Both force arrows (Fbee and Fstigma) clearly shown
- All charges, dimensions, and distances properly labeled

## Files Created
1. `/Users/Pramod/projects/iit-exams/jee-test-nextjs/physics_exports/question_14_new_diagram.svg` - Standalone SVG file
2. Updated HTML with integrated diagram
3. Python scripts for SVG replacement (v2 and v3)

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - Question 14 SVG diagram successfully redrawn and integrated
