# SVG Diagram Replacement Report

## Summary
Successfully replaced 2 SVG diagrams showing the electrostatics setup with charges q₁ = +4e, q₂ = -2e, and Q = +16e at point P.

## Files Modified
- **File:** `/Users/Pramod/projects/iit-exams/jee-test-nextjs/physics_exports/physics_questions_01_of_05.html`
- **Size Change:** 499,457 → 505,914 bytes (+6,457 bytes)

## Diagrams Replaced

### 1. Question 26 (labeled as "Question 16" in text)
**Location:** Line ~6776
**Features:**
- ✓ XY coordinate grid (light gray)
- ✓ X and Y axes with arrows
- ✓ q₁ = +4e (red positive charge)
- ✓ q₂ = -2e (blue negative charge)
- ✓ Point P with Q = +16e (orange charge)
- ✓ Distance d = 1.40 cm from q₁ to P (labeled, dashed line)
- ✓ Distance 2.00d = 2.80 cm from q₂ to P (labeled, dashed line)
- ✓ **Angle θ₁ = 43°** (orange arc from q₁)
- ✓ **Angle θ₂ = 60°** (purple arc from q₂)
- ✓ Path from infinity (dashed line from right)
- ✓ Legend box (Positive/Negative/Distance/Path)
- **ViewBox:** 700×550

### 2. Question 35 (labeled as "Question 10" in text)
**Location:** Line ~8697
**Features:**
- ✓ XY coordinate grid (light gray)
- ✓ X and Y axes with arrows
- ✓ q₁ = +4e (red positive charge)
- ✓ q₂ = -2e (blue negative charge)
- ✓ Point P with Q = +16e (orange charge)
- ✓ Distance d = 1.40 cm from q₁ to P (labeled, dashed line)
- ✓ Distance 2.00d = 2.80 cm from q₂ to P (labeled, dashed line)
- ✓ Path from infinity (dashed line from right)
- ✓ Legend box (Positive/Negative/Distance/Path)
- **ViewBox:** 700×500
- **Note:** NO angles (simpler version)

## Key Differences Between Diagrams
- **Question 26:** Includes angle indicators (θ₁ = 43° and θ₂ = 60°) with reference lines
- **Question 35:** Simpler version without angle indicators

## Verification
```bash
# Confirmed presence of new SVG markers
grep -c "arrowQ26" physics_questions_01_of_05.html  # Returns: 3
grep -c "arrowQ35" physics_questions_01_of_05.html  # Returns: 3
grep -c 'id="grid"' physics_questions_01_of_05.html  # Returns: 3
grep -c 'id="legend"' physics_questions_01_of_05.html  # Returns: 3

# Confirmed angles only in Q26
# Line 6861: θ₁ = 43° in Q26 SVG
# Line 6865: θ₂ = 60° in Q26 SVG
# Q35 section: NO angle markers (confirmed)
```

## Visual Features
Both diagrams now include:
1. Professional coordinate grid background
2. Clearly labeled axes (x, y)
3. Origin point marked at (0,0)
4. Color-coded charges:
   - Red: Positive charges (+4e, +16e)
   - Blue: Negative charge (-2e)
5. Dashed lines for distances with rotated labels
6. Path from infinity indication
7. Comprehensive legend box

## Completion Status
✅ Task completed successfully
- Both SVGs replaced with improved versions
- Q26 includes angles as required
- Q35 is simpler without angles as required
- All measurements and charges clearly labeled
- Professional appearance with coordinate grids
