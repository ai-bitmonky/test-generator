## 🔍 Sample AI-Generated Content

### Question: Coordinate_Geometry_192

**AI-Generated Strategy:**
> "To solve coordinate geometry problems involving circles: 1) Identify the given information (center, radius, points on circle). 2) Use the distance formula or circle equation (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r². 3) Substitute known values to find unknowns. 4) Verify the solution satisfies all given conditions."

**AI-Generated Expert Insight:**
> "An exam topper would immediately write down the standard form of the circle equation and identify what's given versus what needs to be found. The key is to translate geometric conditions into algebraic equations systematically."

**AI-Generated Key Facts:**
> "Standard circle equation: (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r² where (h,k) is center and r is radius; Distance formula: d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²]; Diameter endpoints satisfy circle equation; Tangent line is perpendicular to radius at point of contact."

**AI-Generated Options (when missing):**
```
A: r = 3
B: r = 5
C: r = 7 (Correct)
D: r = 9
```

**AI-Generated Solution (when missing):**
```html
<div class="solution">
  <h4>Solution:</h4>
  <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Write the standard form of circle equation...</p>
  <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Substitute the given center coordinates...</p>
  <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use the point on circle to find radius...</p>
  <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Calculate: r² = (x-h)² + (y-k)²...</p>
  <p><strong>Final Answer:</strong> r = 7 (Option C)</p>
</div>
