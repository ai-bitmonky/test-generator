## Solution Highlights

### Question 1: Multi-Part Electric Field Problem
**Part 1 - Concentric Rings:**
- Inner ring (R, +Q) and outer ring (3R, Q')
- Electric field at z = 2R on axis
- Formula: E = (kQz)/(z¬≤ + R¬≤)^(3/2)

**Part 2 - Electron-Proton Meeting:**
- Separation d = 5.0 cm
- Meeting point calculation using mass ratio
- Result: ~27 Œºm from positive plate (matches given)

**Part 3 - Semi-Infinite Rod:**
- 45¬∞ angle proof (detailed in Question 2)

### Question 4: Car Braking Analysis
- Car weight: 11 kN
- Axle separation: L = 4.2 m
- COM: d = 1.8 m behind front, h = 0.75 m above road
- **Key insight:** Friction force creates torque due to COM height
- **Result:** N_front = 3040 N per wheel

### Question 6: Fluid Work Calculation
- Pipe radii: r‚ÇÅ = 2R, r‚ÇÇ = R, r‚ÇÉ = 3R
- Continuity equation: A‚ÇÅv‚ÇÅ = A‚ÇÇv‚ÇÇ = A‚ÇÉv‚ÇÉ
- v‚ÇÅ = 0.125 m/s, v‚ÇÇ = 0.5 m/s, v‚ÇÉ = 0.0556 m/s
- **Result:** W = -97.5 J (negative as water slows)

### Question 12: Skier Projectile Motion
- Launch: v‚ÇÄ = 10 m/s at Œ∏‚ÇÄ = 11.3¬∞
- Landing on 9¬∞ downward slope
- Trajectory calculation with slope intersection
