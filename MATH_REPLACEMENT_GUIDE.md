## üöÄ Step-by-Step Replacement Process

### Step 1: Update Database Schema

**IMPORTANT**: Run this FIRST in Supabase SQL Editor

```sql
-- File: update_schema_for_physics.sql
-- This adds necessary columns for enhanced metadata

ALTER TABLE questions
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subject VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'Mathematics',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS chapter VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS subtopic VARCHAR(255),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS tags JSONB DEFAULT '[]'::jsonb,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS question_type VARCHAR(100),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS question_html TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS strategy TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS expert_insight TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS key_facts TEXT;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_questions_subject ON questions(subject);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_questions_chapter ON questions(chapter);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_questions_tags ON questions USING GIN(tags);

UPDATE questions SET subject = 'Mathematics' WHERE subject IS NULL;

DROP VIEW IF EXISTS question_stats;
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW question_stats AS
SELECT
  subject,
  COALESCE(chapter, topic) as chapter_or_topic,
  topic,
  difficulty,
  COUNT(*) as question_count
FROM questions
GROUP BY subject, COALESCE(chapter, topic), topic, difficulty
ORDER BY subject, chapter_or_topic, topic, difficulty;

GRANT SELECT ON question_stats TO authenticated;
```

### Step 2: Backup Current Database (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
node backup_database.js
```

This creates a backup in `./backups/backup_TIMESTAMP/`

### Step 3: Run Replacement Script

```bash
node replace_math_questions.js
```

### What the Script Does:

1. **Counts** existing mathematics questions
2. **Deletes** all existing mathematics questions (subject = 'Mathematics')
3. **Loads** 291 new questions from `complete_math_questions.json`
4. **Inserts** new questions in batches of 50
5. **Reports** statistics and verification

### Expected Output:

```
üîÑ Starting Mathematics question replacement...

üìä Checking existing mathematics questions...
Found 142 existing mathematics questions

üóëÔ∏è  Deleting existing mathematics questions...
‚úÖ Deleted 142 mathematics questions

## üìä New Questions Structure

### Enhanced Metadata

Each new mathematics question includes:

```json
{
  "id": "Calculus_1",
  "subject": "Mathematics",
  "chapter": "Calculus",
  "topic": "Integration",
  "subtopic": "Definite and Indefinite Integrals",
  "tags": ["INTEGRATION", "IIT_JEE", "JEE_ADVANCED"],
  "type": "Multiple Choice Single Answer",
  "difficulty": "HARD",
  "question": "The line y = x + 1 divided the area...",
  "question_html": "<div>...</div>",
  "options": {
    "a": "2 : 1",
    "b": "1 : 3",
    "c": "2 : 3",
    "d": "1 : 1"
  },
  "correct_answer": "d",
  "solution_html": "<div>...</div>",
  "solution_text": "Solution: Step 1: ..."
}
```

## üîç Verification

### After Running Replacement

Verify in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Check total count
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM questions WHERE subject = 'Mathematics';
-- Should return: 291

-- Check chapter distribution
SELECT chapter, COUNT(*)
FROM questions
WHERE subject = 'Mathematics'
GROUP BY chapter
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

-- Check difficulty distribution
SELECT difficulty, COUNT(*)
FROM questions
WHERE subject = 'Mathematics'
GROUP BY difficulty;

-- Check if old questions are gone
SELECT external_id FROM questions
WHERE external_id LIKE 'Derivatives_%'
   OR external_id LIKE 'Differential_%'
   OR external_id LIKE '%differentiability%';
-- Should return: 0 rows
```

   - Adds necessary database columns
   - Creates indexes
   - Updates views

4. **replace_math_questions.js**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Before Replacement
- ‚úÖ **Backup your database first!** (use `node backup_database.js`)
- ‚úÖ Run `update_schema_for_physics.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor
- ‚úÖ Verify schema update completed successfully

### During Replacement
- Script will delete ALL existing mathematics questions
- No undo option (that's why backup is important)
- Takes 1-2 minutes to complete

### After Replacement
- Old 142 questions will be completely removed
- New 291 questions will be available
- Question IDs will be different (e.g., `Calculus_1` instead of `Derivatives_1`)
- User's question history may reference old IDs (they'll just be ignored)

---

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If you need to restore old questions:

### Option 1: Restore from Backup

```bash
# Use your most recent backup
node restore_database.js ./backups/backup_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-MM-SS
```

### Option 2: Restore Original Questions

```bash
# Re-run original migration with old JSON file
# Restore mcq_questions_with_solutions.json
node migrate_questions.js
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Error: "column questions.subject does not exist"

**Solution**: You haven't run the schema update yet!
```bash
# In Supabase SQL Editor, run:
update_schema_for_physics.sql
```

### Error: "Failed to delete questions"

**Solution**: Check RLS policies. You may need to temporarily disable RLS:
```sql
ALTER TABLE questions DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
-- Run replacement script
ALTER TABLE questions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Error: "Duplicate key violation"

**Solution**: Questions with same external_id already exist. Check if you've already run the script.

## üìû Next Steps After Replacement

1. **Test the Application**
   - Generate a test with Mathematics subject
   - Verify new questions appear
   - Check solution display works

2. **Update Frontend (if needed)**
   - Topic selection may need updating
   - Chapter-based filtering
   - Display new metadata (tags, subtopics)

3. **User Communication**
   - Inform users about new questions
   - Note that question history IDs may not match
   - Highlight increased question bank

4. **Create New Backup**
   ```bash
   node backup_database.js
   ```
